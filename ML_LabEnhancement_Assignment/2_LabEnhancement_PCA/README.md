## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a customer segmentation dataset. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible, and to analyze the principal components for meaningful insights. The project includes loading and preprocessing data, implementing PCA, and visualizing the principal components.

## Dataset

### Customer Segmentation Dataset
- **Source:** [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering)
- **Description:** This dataset contains various features related to customer demographics and purchasing behavior. It is used to segment customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing and other business strategies.

## Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Loading and preparing the dataset.

2. **Implementing PCA**:
   - Step-by-step implementation of the PCA algorithm using Python.
   - Standardization of the data.
   - Calculation of covariance matrix.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Visualization of the explained variance by the principal components.
   - Plotting the principal components to visualize the data in reduced dimensions.
   - Interpretation of the principal components and their significance.
