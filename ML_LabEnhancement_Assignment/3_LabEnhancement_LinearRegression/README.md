## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression on a graduate admissions dataset. The goal is to predict the chance of admission based on various features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, and more. The project includes loading and preprocessing data, implementing Linear Regression, and evaluating the model.

## Dataset

### Graduate Admissions Dataset
- **Source:** [Graduate Admissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)
- **Description:** This dataset contains several parameters that are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters include GRE Scores, TOEFL Scores, University Rating, Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letter of Recommendation (LOR), CGPA, Research experience, and the chance of admission.

## Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Loading and preparing the dataset.

2. **Implementing Linear Regression**:
   - Step-by-step implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm using Python.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training the model and making predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Metrics to evaluate the quality of the regression model, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Visualizing the regression line and residuals to interpret the model's performance.
