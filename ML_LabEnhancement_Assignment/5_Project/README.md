## Introduction

This project involves the analysis of birth rates using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand the trends and patterns in birth rates over time and across different regions. The project includes data preparation, visualization, implementation of machine learning models, and evaluation of the results.

## Dataset

### Datasets Used
1. **birth_rates_extra.csv**
   - Description: Contains additional data on birth rates.
2. **API_MYS_DS2_en_csv_v2_751601.csv**
   - Description: Contains data from the World Bank.
3. **birth.csv**
   - Description: Contains historical data on birth rates.

## Overview

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loading and cleaning the datasets.
   - Merging datasets to create a comprehensive view.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.
   - Plotting trends and patterns in birth rates, GDP per Capita, population rates over time.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
     - Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining variance.
   - **Linear Regression**:
     - Predicting birth rates based on various features.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
   - Visualizing model performance and results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
   - Discussing potential improvements and future work.
