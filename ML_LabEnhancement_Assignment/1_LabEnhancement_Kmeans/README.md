## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means clustering on the World Happiness Report 2017 dataset. The goal is to segment countries into distinct clusters based on selected features, and to analyze the resulting clusters for meaningful insights. The project includes loading and preprocessing data, implementing K-Means clustering, and visualizing the clusters.

## Dataset

### World Happiness Report 2017
- **Source:** [World Happiness Report 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- **Description:** This dataset contains various indicators of happiness and well-being for countries around the world, including GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and more.

## Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Loading and preparing the dataset.

2. **Implementing K-Means Clustering**:
   - Step-by-step implementation of the K-Means algorithm using Python.
   - Initialization of cluster centroids.
   - Iterative process of assigning data points to clusters and updating centroids.

3. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Discussion on different initialization techniques to improve clustering results.
   - Methods to determine the optimal number of clusters (e.g., Elbow method).

4. **Evaluation of Clustering Results**:
   - Metrics to evaluate the quality of clustering, such as Within-Cluster-Sum of Squared Errors (WCSS).
   - Visualizing the clustering results to interpret the algorithm's performance.
