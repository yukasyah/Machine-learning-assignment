## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression on a heart disease prediction dataset. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease based on various features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The project includes loading and preprocessing data, implementing Logistic Regression, and evaluating the model.

## Dataset

### Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
- **Source:** [Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression)
- **Description:** This dataset contains several medical parameters that are considered important in the prediction of heart disease. The parameters include age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

## Overview

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Loading and preparing the dataset.

2. **Implementing Logistic Regression**:
   - Step-by-step implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm using Python.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training the model and making predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Metrics to evaluate the quality of the classification model, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
   - Confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.
   - ROC curve and AUC score for evaluating the model's discriminative ability.
